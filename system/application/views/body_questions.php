			<dt>What is this all about?</dt>
			<dd>This web service is a collection of magical moments submitted by the luckiest people on Earth.  These fortunate souls are invited to submit the moment when they knew the person they love was "the one."  For the rest of us, we can view their special moments, heart them, share them and hopefully by virtue of their anonymous collection be moved and reassured by them.</dd>
			<dt>Why is it anonymous?</dt>
			<dd>As these moments are intensely personal, their submission has been made deliberately anonymous to encourage people to share their moments while maintaining their personal value.  The geography is inputted by the person sharing the moment and is unverified, intended as decoration rather than identification.  I couldn't find who submitted a particular moment even if I wanted to.</dd>
			<dt>So you don't know anything about the people writing on this site?</dt>
			<dd>Nope, except that they love someone very much.</dd>
			<dt>What are "hearts?"</dt>
			<dd>If you feel a moment moved you, you are welcome to express your affinity by clicking the "heart" icon.  Moments that collect the most hearts will eventually be moved to our greatest collection.</dd>
			<dt>What are "tags?"</dt>
			<dd>Tags are little predefined descriptors for moments that users can add like "sweet," "touching" or "funny."  Like hearts crowdsource a description of the natural affinity of a particular moment, tags segregate those moments into a few distinct groups.  Like hearts, they are anonymous and aggregated.</dd>
			<dt>Can I see <em>how i knew you were the one</em> on my mobile device?</dt>
			<dd>You can access the latest moment via SMS by texting LAST to <strong>(347)441-0919</strong>.  You can also text RANDOM to get one moment sent back at random.  You can also submit moments on the road using the numbers on <?= anchor('submit', 'our submission page'); ?>.</dd>
			<dt>How do I contact the website?</dt>
			<dd>You can reach the developer of this website at howiknew [at] gmail [dot] com.</dd>
			<dt>How do I advertise on your site?</dt>
			<dd>I am not yet accepting advertising.</dd>
